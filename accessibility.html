                    Yes on the activity page the performance is low, but since we use big high quality images the loading time is longer. But the accessibility

                <h2>Short report on accessibility</h2>
                <p>As a group, we focused on universal design principles to create an accessible and user-friendly website. We used semantic HTML5 elements, such as <strong>nav</strong>, <strong>main</strong>, <strong>section</strong>, <strong>header</strong>, and <strong>footer</strong>, to provide a clear structure that benefits screen readers and enhances the websiteâ€™s usability. To ensure logical organization, 
                    we collaboratively maintained a proper heading hierarchy (h1-h4), making the content easy to navigate for all users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We implemented <strong>details</strong> and <strong>summary</strong> elements for expandable content sections, allowing users to reveal information 
                    as needed without overwhelming the page layout. Our navigation menu is consistent across all pages, with descriptive link text that avoids generic terms like "click here," ensuring clarity and accessibility. External links open in new tabs (target="_blank) with clear descriptions, 
                    helping users understand the context of their actions.
                </p>
                <p>For visual design, we worked together to maintain high contrast ratios, ensuring readability for users with visual impairments. We also used CSS variables to standardize styles and make the design easier to maintain. To improve accessibility on all devices, we implemented responsive design techniques,
                    ensuring the site adapts to various screen sizes. Interactive elements include hover states, providing visual feedback that enhances usability.</p>

                <p>Regarding images and media, we ensured all images included descriptive alt text or empty alt attributes for decorative elements, supporting screen reader accessibility. Images were optimized to scale properly and maintain their aspect ratios to prevent distortion across devices. These collaborative coding choices reflect our shared commitment to 
                    creating an inclusive, functional, and aesthetically pleasing website for diverse users.
